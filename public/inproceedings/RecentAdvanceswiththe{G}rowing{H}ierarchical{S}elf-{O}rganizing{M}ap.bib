  abstract = { We present our recent work on the Growing Hierarchical Self-Organizing Map, a dynamically growing neural network model which evolves into a hierarchical structure according to the necessities of the input data during an unsupervised training process. The benefits of this novel architecture are shown by organizing a real-world document collection according to semantic similarities. },

  abstract = { Self-Organizing Maps have a wide range of beneficial properties for data mining, like vector quantization and projection. Several measures exist that quantify the quality of either of these properties. The scope of this work is to describe and compare some of the most well-known measures. This is done by conducting a series of experiments for different map topologies with several well-known data sets. The measures are examined whether they are suited to determine hyperparameters like the optimal map size, how well the measure itself is suited to compare different maps, and if they allow comparison to other algorithms similar to the SOM (e.g. Sammons Mapping). },

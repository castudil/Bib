  abstract = { We present a strategy by which a Self-OrganizingMap (SOM) with an underlying Binary Search Tree (BST) structure can be adaptively re-structured using conditional rotations. These rotations on the nodes of the tree are local and are performed in constant time, guaranteeing a decrease in the Weighted Path Length (WPL) of the entire tree. As a result, the algorithm, referred to as the Tree-based Topology-Oriented SOM with Conditional Rotations (TTO-CONROT), converges in such a manner that the neurons are ultimately placed in the input space so as to represent its stochastic distribution, and additionally, the neighborhood properties of the neurons suit the best BST that represents the data. },

  abstract = { Self-organizing maps (SOM) are unsupervised, competitive neural networks used to project high-dimensional data onto a low-dimensional space. In this paper it is shown that SOM can be used to perform multidimensional scaling (MDS) on graphs. The SOM-based approach is applied to two families of random graphs and three real-world networks. },

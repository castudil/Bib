  abstract = { This paper presents neural network-based system for the characterization of ultrasonic transducers. An automated system for characterizing ultrasonic transducers was designed and built. Different characterizing algorithms were applied and their performance was investigated and compared. It was found that artificial neural network (ANN) techniques, in general, provide better classification as compared to the pattern recognition techniques we applied earlier (M.S. Obaidat, J.W. Ekis, IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurements, 40 (5) (1991) 847-850). The Moody-Darken Radial Basis Function network (MD-RBFN), Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ) with 52 kohonen neurons, and Fuzzy ARTMAP classification network are the neural networks (NNs) that provided us with a classification accuracy of 100%. Several variants of Backpropagation neural network (BPNN) were tested for this application, and the classification results were seen to vary in the range 6.55%-98.35%. The best performing paradigm among several variants of the Modular Neural Network (MNN), Reinforcement Neural Network (RNN), Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN), and Counterpropagation Neural Network (CPNN) produced a classification accuracy of 78.85%, 31.42%, 45.21%, and 79.28%, respectively. The competitive learning (CL) technique provided poor results as compared to the Self-Organizing-Map (SOM) for preclustering. },

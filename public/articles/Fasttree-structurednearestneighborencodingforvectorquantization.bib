  abstract = { This work examines the nearest neighbor encoding problem with an unstructured codebook of arbitrary size and vector dimension. We propose a new tree-structured nearest neighbor encoding method that significantly reduces the complexity of the full-search method without any performance degradation in terms of distortion. Our method consists of efficient algorithms for constructing a binary tree for the codebook and nearest neighbor encoding by using this tree. Numerical experiments are given to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method },

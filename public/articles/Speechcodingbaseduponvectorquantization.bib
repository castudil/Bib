  abstract = { With rare exception, all presently available narrow-band speech coding systems implement scalar quantization (independent quantization) of the transmission parameters (such as reflection coefficients or transformed reflection coefficients in LPC systems). This paper presents a new approach called vector quantization. For very low data rates, realistic experiments have shown that vector quantization can achieve a given level of average distortion with 15 to 20 fewer bits/frame than that required for the optimized scalar quantizing approaches presently in use. The vector quantizing approach is shown to be a mathematically and computationally tractable method which builds upon knowledge obtained in linear prediction analysis studies. This paper introduces the theory in a nonrigorous form, along with practical results to date and an extensive list of research topics for this new area of speech coding. },

  abstract = { Extraction of skeletal shape from a 2D dot pattern is discussed. We use a self-organizing neural network model to get a piecewise linear approximation of a skeleton of the pattern. It is found that even without a proper definition of a skeleton, the proposed algorithm is able to produce skeletons that are quite close to what we intuitively feel it should be. In Kohonen's self-organizing model, the set of processors and their neighbourhoods are fixed. We suggest here some modifications of it in which the set of processors and their neighbourhoods change adaptively },

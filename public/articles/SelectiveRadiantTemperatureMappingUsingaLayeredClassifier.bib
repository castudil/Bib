  abstract = { A method of measuring temperatures of selected ground cover types using remotely sensed multispectral scanner data and a layered classification approach is described. A brief review of radiation theory is presented to show that for the wavelength bands and temperature ranges involved in remote sensing applications, a linear calibration function can be satisfactorily utilized. Finally, an example of the application of the layered classifier for temperature mapping of water is shown. },

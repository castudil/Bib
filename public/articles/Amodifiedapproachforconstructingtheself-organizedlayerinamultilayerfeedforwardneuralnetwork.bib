  abstract = { One of the most important models in neural network research is the backpropagation algorithm for the multilayer feedforward network. A major disadvantage of using a conventional backpropagation algorithm is that its training process can be very slow, since the network is assigned with random initial weights and an arbitrarily assigned hidden layer structure. We are using self-organizing back propagation and modified self-organizing back propagation algorithms to greatly reduce its training time. These algorithms are used to solve the exclusive-or problem and to classify multispectral image data. The results demonstrate that the new approaches can greatly reduce the number of interations required in the training process. },

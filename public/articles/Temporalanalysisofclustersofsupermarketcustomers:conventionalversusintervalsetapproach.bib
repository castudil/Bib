  abstract = { Temporal data mining is the application of data mining techniques to data that takes the time dimension into account. This paper studies changes in cluster characteristics of supermarket customers over a 24 week period. Such an analysis can be useful for formulating marketing strategies. Marketing managers may want to focus on specific groups of customers. Therefore they may need to understand the migrations of the customers from one group to another group. The marketing strategies may depend on the desirability of these cluster migrations. The temporal analysis presented here is based on conventional and modified Kohonen self organizing maps (SOM). The modified Kohonen SOM creates interval set representations of clusters using properties of rough sets. A description of an experimental design for temporal cluster migration studies including, data cleaning, data abstraction, data segmentation, and data sorting, is provided. The paper compares conventional and non-conventional (interval set) clustering techniques, as well as temporal and non-temporal analysis of customer loyalty. The interval set clustering is shown to provide an interesting dimension to such a temporal analysis. },

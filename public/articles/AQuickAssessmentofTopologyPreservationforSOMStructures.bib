  abstract = { Several topology preservation measures and monitoring schemes have been proposed to help ascertain the correct organization of the self-organizing map (SOM) structure. Here, we consider a novel idea that performs faster than previous alternatives while showing interesting behavior in practice. Our proposal aims to facilitate inexpensive, online monitoring of topographic map formation algorithms. },

  abstract = { Clustering problems arise in various domains of science and engineering. A large number of methods have been developed to date. The Kohonen self-organizing map (SOM) is a popular tool that maps a high-dimensional space onto a small number of dimensions by placing similar elements close together, forming clusters. Cluster analysis is often left to the user. In this paper we present the method TreeSOM and a set of tools to perform unsupervised SOM cluster analysis, determine cluster confidence and visualize the result as a tree facilitating comparison with existing hierarchical classifiers. We also introduce a distance measure for cluster trees that allows one to select a SOM with the most confident clusters. },

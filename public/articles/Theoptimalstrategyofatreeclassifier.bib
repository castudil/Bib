  abstract = { This paper deals with the decision rules of a tree classifier for performing the classification at each nonterminal node, under the assumption of complete probabilistic information. For given tree structure and feature subsets to be used, the optimal decision rules (strategy) are derived which minimize the overall probability of misclassification. The primary result is illustrated by an example. },

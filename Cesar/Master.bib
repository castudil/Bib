  abstract = {The splay technique was introduced to cope with biasedness or changeability
	in data access frequencies, achieving optimality within a small constant
	factor w.r.t. static trees, without sacrificing log N worst-case
	behaviour, in an amortized sense. It achieves this through a series
	of local transformations, starting from the search node and propagating
	upwards along the search path to the root. It seems plausible that
	a similar policy, suitably adapted to multi-way trees, could achieve
	logk N amortized performance (nodes visited), where k is the degree
	of the tree. Sherk’s k-splay, a generalization of Sleator and Tarjan’s
	splay technique to multi-way trees, proved to exhibit amortized log2
	N behaviour, could be considered the most likely candidate for a
	multi-way splay-like self-adjusting policy with logk N amortized
	complexity. We construct a family of k-ary trees having depth k and
	containing 2k nodes and we show that Sherk’s k-splay applied to the
	deepest node of any tree in this family always produces another tree
	in the family. A fractal-like process of replacing leaf-nodes of
	trees with copies of themselves then allows us to create such trees
	of arbitrary size for any given k. This provides us with a family
	of counterexamples for which Sherk’s k-splay always visits log2 N
	nodes when applied to the deepest node in the tree.},

	from specific instances. This approach extends the nearest neighbor
	algorithm, which has large storage requirements. We describe how
	storage requirements can be significantly reduced with, at most,
	minor sacrifices in learning rate and classification accuracy. While
	the storage-reducing algorithm performs well on several real-world
	databases, its performance degrades rapidly with the level of attribute
	noise in training instances. Therefore, we extended it with a significance
	test to distinguish noisy instances. This extended algorithm's performance
	degrades gracefully with increasing noise levels and compares favorably
	with a noise-tolerant decision tree algorithm.},

	input, and the more recent definition of kernels for structures,
	makes it possible to directly apply machine learning approaches to
	generic structured data. However, the effectiveness of a kernel can
	depend on its sparsity with respect to a specific data set. In fact,
	the accuracy of a kernel method typically reduces as the kernel sparsity
	increases. The sparsity problem is particularly common in structured
	domains involving discrete variables which may take on many different
	values. In this paper, we explore this issue on two well-known kernels
	for trees, and propose to face it by recurring to self-organizing
	maps (SOMs) for structures. Specifically, we show that a suitable
	combination of the two approaches, obtained by defining a new class
	of kernels based on the activation map of a SOM for structures, can
	be effective in avoiding the sparsity problem and results in a system
	that can be significantly more accurate for categorization tasks
	on structured data. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is
	demonstrated experimentally on two relatively large corpora of XML

  abstract = {The SOM has several beneficial features which make it a useful method

	that can be used to quantify the goodness of the map in order to
	obtain the optimal projection, including the average quantization
	error and many topological errors. Many researches have studied how
	the topology preservation should be measured. One option consists
	of using the topographic error which considers the ratio of data
	vectors for which the first and second best BMUs are not adjacent.
	In this work we present a study of the behaviour of the topographic
	error in different kinds of maps. We have found that this error devaluates
	the rectangular maps and we have studied the reasons why this happens.
	Finally, we suggest a new topological error to improve the deficiency

  abstract = {The beauty of the Kohonen map is that it has the property of organizing
	the codebook vectors, which represent the data points, both with
	respect to the underlying distribution and topologically. This topology
	is traditionally linear, even though the underlying lattice could
	be a grid, and this has been used in a variety of applications [23],
	[35] and [40]. The most prominent efforts to render the topology
	to be structured involves the Evolving Tree (ET) due to Pakkanen
	et al. [36], and the Self-Organizing Tree Maps (SOTM) due to Guan
	et al. [18], among others. In this paper we propose a strategy, the
	Tree-Based Topology-Oriented SOM (TTOSOM) by which we can impose
	an arbitrary, user-defined, tree-like topology onto the codebooks.
	Such an imposition enforces a neighborhood phenomenon which is based
	on the user-defined tree, and consequently renders the so-called
	bubble of activity to be drastically different from the ones defined
	in the prior literature. The map learned as a consequence of training
	with the TTOSOM is able to infer both the distribution of the data
	and its structured topology interpreted via the perspective of the
	user-defined tree. The TTOSOM also reveals multi-resolution capabilities,
	which are helpful for representing the original data set with different
	numbers of points, and this can be obtained without the necessity
	of recomputing the whole tree. The ability to extract an skeleton,
	which is a #stick-like# representation of the image in a lower dimensional
	space, is discussed as well. These properties has been confirmed
	by our experimental results on a variety of data sets.},
